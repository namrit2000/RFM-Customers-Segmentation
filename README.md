# Customer Segmentation Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on performing Customer Segmentation analysis using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) method on an eCommerce dataset. The goal is to categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior, allowing for targeted marketing and retention strategies.

## Objective
Perform RFM analysis on the dataset, calculate RFM scores for each customer, segment customers using clustering techniques, and provide actionable marketing recommendations for each segment.

## Tasks
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Import the dataset and perform necessary data preprocessing steps, including cleaning and handling missing values.

2. **RFM Calculation:**
   - Calculate Recency (R), Frequency (F), and Monetary (M) metrics for each customer.

3. **RFM Segmentation:**
   - Assign RFM scores to each customer based on quartiles or custom-defined bins.
   - Combine RFM scores to create a single score for each customer.

4. **Customer Segmentation:**
   - Use clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means) to segment customers based on RFM scores.
   - Experiment with cluster numbers for optimal segmentation.

5. **Segment Profiling:**
   - Analyze and profile each customer segment, describing their characteristics and RFM scores.

6. **Marketing Recommendations:**
   - Provide actionable marketing recommendations for each segment to improve customer retention and revenue.

7. **Visualization:**
   - Create visualizations (bar charts, scatter plots) to illustrate RFM distribution and formed clusters.
